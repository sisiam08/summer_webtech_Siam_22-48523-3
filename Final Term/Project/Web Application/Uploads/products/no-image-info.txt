This directory should contain a no-image.jpg placeholder file.

Since I cannot create binary image files directly, please add a simple placeholder image file:
1. Create a 300x300 pixel image with light gray background
2. Add text "No Image Available" in the center
3. Save as "no-image.jpg" in this directory

Alternatively, the fallback CSS and onerror handlers in the code will handle missing images gracefully.
